"\n"
"<p>\n"
"<a href=\"/help/polity/\">Polities</a> are groups of people who come "
"together to make decisions and enact their will.\n"
"The decisions they make collectively are <b>agreements</b>. An agreement is "
"generally made about a document, which\n"
"generally consists of a list of statements which the members of the polity "
"generally agree to.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"There's a lot of \"generally\" in there, because different polities do "
"things in different ways.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Conditions of adoption</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the rules of the polity, different conditions may apply to how "
"an agreement gets accepted.\n"
"When an agreement has been accepted under the rules of a polity, it is "
"normally said that it has been \"adopted\".\n"
"In the most simple approach, if more than half of the members of the polity "
"who participate in a vote on the matter\n"
"agree, then the relevant document gets adopted.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>More complicated methods might require consensus (everybody agrees), some "
"other amount of support (say, 2/3), or\n"
"there could be a minimum number of members required to cast votes in order "
"for it to be adopted.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>A more obscure, but interesting condition, is \"rolling adoption\" - that "
"at every point in time, enough\n"
"members of the polity must accept the document for it to remain adopted, "
"otherwise it becomes \"unadopted\".\n"
"This requires that new members go through previous agreements and acccept or "
"reject them, otherwise they\n"
"might simply be aged out of the polity.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Document structure</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the rules of the polity, an agreement document may have very "
"varying structure. A common example for international treaties is that "
"documents\n"
"consist of references to previous agreements, followed by a list of "
"assumptions made by the authors of the agreement, followed by a list of "
"declarations\n"
"which the signatory polities agree to. <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa."
"eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+WDECL+P7-DCL-2010-0047+0+DOC+PDF"

"different parts to see what they're for.\n"

"<p>\n"
"Polities are groups of people who come together to make decisions and enact "
"their will.\n"
"These are given various names depending on their form, structure, intent, "
"scale and scope.\n"
"Therefore they are variously called \"countries\", \"towns\", \"clubs\", "
"\"cabals\", \"mafias\", \"federations\",\n"
"\"treaties\", \"unions\", \"associations\", \"companies\", \"phyles\", "
"\"tribes\", \"counties\", \"regions\", \n"
"or any other of a number of different terms.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The reason we use the word \"polity\" in Wasa2il is that it is the most "
"generic term we could\n"
"find. It says nothing of the form, the structure, the intent, scale or scope "
"of the group\n"
"of people, nor does it preclude anything. Using the word \"group\" could "
"work too, but it lacks\n"
"the imporant factor that there is an intent to make decisions and enact "
"will.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In addition to consisting of a group of people, a polity will have a set of "
"laws\n"
"the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a "
"polity\n"
"grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership in "
"a \n"
"school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual prom,\n"
"and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a "
"right \n"
"to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand "
"in \n"
"elections, and so on.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws or "
"laws - \n"
"which affect the polity on two different levels.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how\n"
"decisions are made and how governance in general \n"
"happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying \n"
"meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that Wasa2il "
"isn't \n"
"useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as \"rules of procedure"
"\" \n"
"or \"constitution\", depending on the type of polity which is using them.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity makes "
"which\n"
"don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"It is hard to talk about a term completely in the abstract. We can describe "
"its features, but\n"
"that only gets us so far. So let's look at some of the things that can vary "
"from one polity\n"
"to another, and then take a few examples in each.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scope of a polity determines the range of things that the polity "
"concerns itself with. The\n"
"scope may be a geographic region, a set of ideas, a particular part of "
"social activity, or\n"
"a common interest of its members.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>La Casa Invisible</i> is a social center in Málaga, Spain, which works in "
"the Málaga region\n"
"to promote ideas of social cohesion, autonomy, and democracy. It operates a "
"café, a book store,\n"
"a music hall, and various other projects, each of which could be considered "
"a sub-polity of\n"
"the social center itself. The scope of La Casa Invisible's actions is mostly "
"bound to decisions\n"
"regarding the social center itself, and the activities that take place "
"within it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>The Union of the Comoros (Udzima wa Komori)</i> is an island nation to "
"the east of Africa, \n"
"just north of Madagascar. It has a population of 798.000 people living in an "
"area of 2.235km². \n"
"The scope of The Comoros as a polity is the land and national waters they "
"control, their airspace,\n"
"and their foreign trade, defense and other agreements they are party to. As "
"such, they have\n"
"municipal sub-polities, and are a member of the African Union, Francophonie, "
"Organization of Islamic\n"
"Cooperation, Arab League and Indian Ocean Commission superpolities, amongst "
"others.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scale</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scale of a polity determines how large it can be expected to become. "
"Some polities are specifically\n"
"structured with intent to grow, while others intentionally try to stay at a "
"constant size.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>Muff Divers</i> is a diving club in the village of Muff in Ireland. It "
"claims to be the fastest\n"
"growing diving club in the world, most likely owing to its name.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Intent</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"A polity is created around intent. Some polities intend to take over the "
"world, others intend to make\n"
"the nicest cupcakes in all of the land. Some polities intend to send people "
"into space, and others\n"
"intend to track down and arrest criminals. Polities have all sorts of "
"motives and intents.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"On the most basic level, a polity's intent is a description of what it "
"intends to do. This has nothing\n"
"to do with whether the polity has the ability to do it, or whether anybody "
"or anything - such as another\n"
"polity, or the laws of physics - stand in their way.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i></i>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Structure</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Representative democracy, direct democracy, participatory democracy, "
"dictatorship. There are lots of terms\n"
"which describe the structure of a polity. In one sense, it refers to where "
"in the structure of relations\n"
"between people the authority lies. In a dictatorship, one person has "
"ultimate authority, although he may\n"
"choose to grant some authority downstream to trusted advisors, who in turn "
"have trusted advisors, and so\n"
"on. In a fully egealitarian system, each individual is equipotent, meaning "
"he has an equal ability to\n"
"everybody else to instigate decisions - however, it depends on the structure "
"what ability the individual\n"
"has to actually complete the decision making.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"

"Before members of a <a href=\"/help/polity/\">polity</a> can reach an <a "
"href=\"/help/agreement/\">agreement</a>, somebody needs to\n"
"propose something to be agreed upon. There are many ways in which a proposal "
"can come about - such as through a lone member\n"
"thinking about a problem, a group of people working together to solve a "
"problem, or couple of people brainstorming. Exactly\n"
"how people come up with ideas isn't really as important, for this "
"discussion, as what happens after the idea has come up.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In Wasa2il, a user who realizes a problem can raise an <a href=\"/help/issue/"
"\">issue</a> in his polity. The issue belongs in\n"
"one or more of the <a href=\"/help/topic/\">topics</a> that the polity is "
"interested in. \n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Depending on the purpose of the polity, a particular issue might not even be "
"appropriate - for instance, if your polity \n"
"is a golf club, it would be strange to raise an issue relating to a tennis "
"court on the other side of town. A good rule \n"
"of thumb is, if there isn't a topic that your issue belongs in, then it's "
"likely that the issue doesn't belong in the\n"
"polity. If you think that it is, perhaps you should raise the issue that "
"there are too few or overly narrow topics in \n"
"your polity!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Once an issue has been raised, there are two things that happen. First, "
"members of the polity can discuss the issue. Secondly,\n"
"members of the polity can work on a solution. The discussion is covered more "
"thoroughly elsewhere. Here, we focus on the\n"
"juicy bit: proposals!\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing a new agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order to propose a new agreement, one makes a <a href=\"/help/document/"
"\">document</a> and attaches it to the issue.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Proposing changes to a previous agreement</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Rather than making a new agreement from scratch every time, which in the "
"best case leads to redundancy, and in the worst case\n"
"can lead to internal contradictions, it is sometimes more appropriate to "
"propose changes to a previous agreement. These can be\n"
"minor changes, such as dropping a word, a sentence or a clause; or major "
"changes, such as restructuring the document in its\n"
"entirety or adding a new chapter.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Making changes to a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"When somebody has made a proposal, members of the polity might agree with it "
"in general but disagree with some specific points,\n"
"or think the wording or language needs some clean up. There are really only "
"four kinds of changes that are possible:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"\t<li>Remove a clause/statement from the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Move a clause/statement within the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Change a clause/statement in the document</li>\n"
"\t<li>Add a clause/statement to the document</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"All other actions are combinations of these four.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h3>Voting on a proposal</h3>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In order for a proposal to be accepted, it needs to be <a href=\"/help/vote"
"\">voted</a> on in accordance with the rules of the polity.\n"
"Before the entire proposal can be voted on, the polity first needs to "
"resolve which version of the document it is voting on. This\n"
"is done by voting on all of the change proposals to the proposal "
"individually first.\n"
