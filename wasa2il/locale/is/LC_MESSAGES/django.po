"<p>\n"
"Polities are groups of people who come together to make decisions and enact "
"their will.\n"
"These are given various names depending on their form, structure, intent, "
"scale and scope.\n"
"Therefore they are variously called \"countries\", \"towns\", \"clubs\", "
"\"cabals\", \"mafias\", \"federations\",\n"
"\"treaties\", \"unions\", \"associations\", \"companies\", \"phyles\", "
"\"tribes\", \"counties\", \"regions\", \n"
"or any other of a number of different terms.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The reason we use the word \"polity\" in Wasa2il is that it is the most "
"generic term we could\n"
"find. It says nothing of the form, the structure, the intent, scale or scope "
"of the group\n"
"of people, nor does it preclude anything. Using the word \"group\" could "
"work too, but it lacks\n"
"the imporant factor that there is an intent to make decisions and enact "
"will.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In addition to consisting of a group of people, a polity will have a set of "
"laws\n"
"the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a "
"polity\n"
"grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership in "
"a \n"
"school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual prom,\n"
"and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a "
"right \n"
"to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand "
"in \n"
"elections, and so on.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws or "
"laws - \n"
"which affect the polity on two different levels.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how\n"
"decisions are made and how governance in general \n"
"happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying \n"
"meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that Wasa2il "
"isn't \n"
"useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as \"rules of procedure"
"\" \n"
"or \"constitution\", depending on the type of polity which is using them.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity makes "
"which\n"
"don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"It is hard to talk about a term completely in the abstract. We can describe "
"its features, but\n"
"that only gets us so far. So let's look at some of the things that can vary "
"from one polity\n"
"to another, and then take a few examples in each.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scope of a polity determines the range of things that the polity "
"concerns itself with. The\n"
"scope may be a geographic region, a set of ideas, a particular part of "
"social activity, or\n"
"a common interest of its members.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>La Casa Invisible</i> is a social center in Málaga, Spain, which works in "
"the Málaga region\n"
"to promote ideas of social cohesion, autonomy, and democracy. It operates a "
"café, a book store,\n"
"a music hall, and various other projects, each of which could be considered "
"a sub-polity of\n"
"the social center itself. The scope of La Casa Invisible's actions is mostly "
"bound to decisions\n"
"regarding the social center itself, and the activities that take place "
"within it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>The Union of the Comoros (Udzima wa Komori)</i> is an island nation to "
"the east of Africa, \n"
"just north of Madagascar. It has a population of 798.000 people living in an "
"area of 2.235km². \n"
"The scope of The Comoros as a polity is the land and national waters they "
"control, their airspace,\n"
"and their foreign trade, defense and other agreements they are party to. As "
"such, they have\n"
"municipal sub-polities, and are a member of the African Union, Francophonie, "
"Organization of Islamic\n"
"Cooperation, Arab League and Indian Ocean Commission superpolities, amongst "
"others.\n"
"</p>\n"

"Polities are groups of people who come together to make decisions and enact "
"their will.\n"
"These are given various names depending on their form, structure, intent, "
"scale and scope.\n"
"Therefore they are variously called \"countries\", \"towns\", \"clubs\", "
"\"cabals\", \"mafias\", \"federations\",\n"
"\"treaties\", \"unions\", \"associations\", \"companies\", \"phyles\", "
"\"tribes\", \"counties\", \"regions\", \n"
"or any other of a number of different terms.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The reason we use the word \"polity\" in Wasa2il is that it is the most "
"generic term we could\n"
"find. It says nothing of the form, the structure, the intent, scale or scope "
"of the group\n"
"of people, nor does it preclude anything. Using the word \"group\" could "
"work too, but it lacks\n"
"the imporant factor that there is an intent to make decisions and enact "
"will.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"In addition to consisting of a group of people, a polity will have a set of "
"laws\n"
"the group has decided to adhere to. In an abstract sense, membership in a "
"polity\n"
"grants a person certain rights and priviledges. For instance, membership in "
"a \n"
"school's student body may grant you the right to attend their annual prom,\n"
"and membership in a country (i.e. residency or citizenship) grants you a "
"right \n"
"to live there and do certain things there, such as start companies. stand "
"in \n"
"elections, and so on.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Each polity has different rules - these are also called statutes, bylaws or "
"laws - \n"
"which affect the polity on two different levels.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Firstly, there are meta-rules, which describe how rules are formed, how\n"
"decisions are made, how meetings happen, and how governance in general \n"
"happens. Wasa2il has to be flexible enough to accomodate the varying \n"
"meta-rules of a given polity, otherwise the polity may decide that Wasa2il "
"isn't \n"
"useful to them. Sometimes these rules are referred to as \"rules of procedure"
"\" \n"
"or \"constitution\", depending on the type of polity which is using them.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Secondly there are external rules, which are the decisions the polity makes "
"which\n"
"don't affect its internal decisionmaking process.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"It is hard to talk about a term completely in the abstract. We can describe "
"its features, but\n"
"that only gets us so far. So let's look at some of the things that can vary "
"from one polity\n"
"to another, and then take a few examples in each.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>Scope</h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"The scope of a polity determines the range of things that the polity "
"concerns itself with. The\n"
"scope may be a geographic region, a set of ideas, a particular part of "
"social activity, or\n"
"a common interest of its members.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>La Casa Invisible</i> is a social center in Málaga, Spain, which works in "
"the Málaga region\n"
"to promote ideas of social cohesion, autonomy, and democracy. It operates a "
"café, a book store,\n"
"a music hall, and various other projects, each of which could be considered "
"a sub-polity of\n"
"the social center itself. The scope of La Casa Invisible's actions is mostly "
"bound to decisions\n"
"regarding the social center itself, and the activities that take place "
"within it.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"<i>The Union of the Comoros (Udzima wa Komori)</i> is an island nation to "
"the east of Africa, \n"
"just north of Madagascar. It has a population of 798.000 people living in an "
"area of 2.235km². \n"
"The scope of The Comoros as a polity is the land and national waters they "
"control, their airspace,\n"
"and their foreign trade, defense and other agreements they are party to. As "
"such, they have\n"
"municipal sub-polities, and are a member of the African Union, Francophonie, "
"Organization of Islamic\n"
"Cooperation, Arab League and Indian Ocean Commission superpolities, amongst "
"others.\n"
