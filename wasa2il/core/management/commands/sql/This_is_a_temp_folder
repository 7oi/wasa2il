This folder is temporary.

It contains (or contained) SQL queries to be run before and after the 'refactor' custom Django command,
which was used to update the database according to a new way of organizing data in the database, in
particular issues, documents, documentcontents and such.

This stuff may temporarily stay in the Git repository for historical reasons or to help people refactor
their own installations, but should not stay there indefinitely.

If the summer of 2014 was a while ago, please remove this folder.
